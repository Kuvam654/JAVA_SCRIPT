# JAVA_SCRIPT
This file contains my journey from a beginner in java script to being a professional.
I'll attach all my code and everything i've learned so that the public can benefit from it.

Java Script which is considered as the langauge of the web. Almost every website runs on java script. Since its inception in 1995, Java Script is used in developing Frontend applications etc.

Using Java Script real time updates are shown on our devices. For example Interactive maps and client side validation.
It is also popular due to the fact that it makes use of "Backwards Compatibility" ie All websites built in the past also need to work today.
Without java Script much of the websites won't work.

There are multiple versions of Java Script depending on where it is used, For example:-
1- Plain JavaScipt - It is used on client side of plain website. It is also known as Vanilla JavaScipt.
2- JavaScipt Frameworks - It makes up JavaScript Frameworks like Node.js, Vue and D3.
3- Server Side - It is used on server side as Node.js and recently Deno.

The popularity of JavaScipt is also due to the reason that
1- Accessible
2- Community
3- Beginner Friendly

Example of its use on server side:-
Clicking buttons on a shopping cart and the way the animations creep up etc

Example of its use on server side:-
Communicating with databases, powering up websites etc

Set aside its use on web, it is also used to make apps using frameworks like React Native and powering up IOT Devices using NODE_Red.

Talking a little about history:-
Initially new browsers came with different design there consisted discrepancie problem between Browsers. Develpers sometimes had to write different code for different browsers.

So there came a JavaScript library called JQuery. It made it things easier for the users. Users just had to import this library and write code using its features.
