functions - Block of code where you perfrom certain action.
declaration:-
function name_of_function(required variables) {
    statement
}
calling a function:-
name_of_function(required variables);

push operation:-
pushes the element to the end of the array.
name_of_function.push(element);

pop operation:-
removes the last element from the array.
name_of_function.pop()

Arrays
var/let/const array_name = [.... , ... , ...];
note - element indexing starts with 0 and goes upto n(no of items) - 1

Objects
Collection of related properties/traits where each property is represented by a key:value pair.

declaring an an object:-
var object_name = {};

declaring an object with property:-
var object_name = {
    property1 : value1;
    property2 : value2;
    and so on
}

Ways to declare an object:-
1. Build Objects with Dot Notation
2. Build Objects with Comma delimited key-value pair

declaring an object and specifying its property outside using dot Notation
var object_name = {};
object_name.property1 = value1;
object_name.property2 = value2;
and so on

declaring an object and specifying its property outside using bracket Notation
var object_name = {};
object_name[property1] = value1;
object_name[property2] = value2;
and so on

Object methods
It is just like the key value pair, the difference being the value which is a function.

Object_name.property = function(condition) {
    Statement
} 
calling the object method
Object_name.property(condition if any);
